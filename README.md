Togo
======

Togo is a todo list for places you want to visit. It uses the Foursquare api to let you find restaurants, bars, burger joints, etc. nearby and add them to an easy to use list.


How it works
==========

This app uses [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) to include [JASidePanels](https://github.com/gotosleep/JASidePanels). The JASidePanel library is used to give the app a side menu similar in functionality to Path or Facebook. In this side menu the user can create, delete or select new lists. The user can also tap and hold on the list name to rename it. 

Once a user has created a list they are able to search for places by name or area, the results are displayed on a MapView or UITableView. From these views the user is able to see more details about a venue and add or remove them from their list.

All of the users lists and favorite places are saved into core data to allow some functionality offline.
